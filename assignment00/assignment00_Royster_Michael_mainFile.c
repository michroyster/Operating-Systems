    Program Description: This program loads an N x M dimension board into a dynamic 2D array
    that is handled by pointer arithmetic. Each position in the array will be an X or -.
    The positions will be flipped to X's or -'s for a user input amount of generations based
    on specifc rules about their neighboring positions. At the end the player's info, date,
    and number of generations played will be written to a text file.
